# HPS-007 — Manufacturer Engineering Data

<a id="hapi-533"></a>
## HAPI-533 — define manufacturer characteristic provisioning

Phase: HPS-007 — Manufacturer Engineering Data

Legacy IDs: HPR-P25-021

Priority: P1

Implementation Status: VERIFIED

Planning Status: COMPLETED

Owning Module: `simulation` (actual source owner; package modules are not separate Maven artifacts)

Dependencies: —

Cross-Repository Dependencies: None independently verified for this bounded task.

### 1. Objective

define manufacturer characteristic provisioning

### 2. Existing Implementation

Party manufacturer references and Simulation bounded immutable equipment parameter revision storage exist internally. These are phase context, not automatic completion evidence for this task. Task-specific current artifacts were matched to the exact tree:

- `doc/model-remediation/RECONCILIATION.md`
- `doc/roadmap/ULTIMATE_ROADMAP.md`

No current file is invented to make a historical allowlist appear complete. Artifact presence and a tested narrow method do not establish the whole business workflow.

### 3. Missing or Incomplete Capabilities

No successor implementation is selected for this completed bounded objective. It is a documentation/review/preflight outcome; broader application functionality remains separate.

### 4. Functional Requirements

Independent cases A–G; mixed parent not closed

Preserve explicit lifecycle, required values, invalid-reference rejection, supported catalog families and uncertainty semantics from the original bounded record. Optional fields are not silently defaulted into engineering facts. A follow-on capability never changes the meaning of a completed preflight.

### 5. Architecture and Domain Design

Bounded Context: `simulation`; primary phase owns this obligation. Current immutable parameter owner remains Simulation until an explicitly authorized ownership change; no interpolation or solver expansion selected. Aggregate/invariant ownership follows the existing domain artifacts below; proposed aggregates must not duplicate another owner. Domain remains pure Java; application coordinates authorization/transactions through ports; REST and persistence/integration remain adapters.

- Domain ownership/invariants: DISCOVERY_REQUIRED for this task; reuse the exact owner inventory below before adding a proposed contract.
- Inbound ports: DISCOVERY_REQUIRED for this task; reuse the exact owner inventory below before adding a proposed contract.
- Outbound ports: DISCOVERY_REQUIRED for this task; reuse the exact owner inventory below before adding a proposed contract.
- Application services: DISCOVERY_REQUIRED for this task; reuse the exact owner inventory below before adding a proposed contract.
- Primary/secondary adapters: DISCOVERY_REQUIRED for this task; reuse the exact owner inventory below before adding a proposed contract.

### 6. Exact File-Level Execution Plan

**CREATE / MODIFY / DELETE:** none selected. Preserve the completed or superseded bounded outcome.

**PRESERVE / REUSE — current matched artifacts:**

- `doc/model-remediation/RECONCILIATION.md`
- `doc/roadmap/ULTIMATE_ROADMAP.md`

Historical-only/deleted proposed paths in the original record are not presented as current files. Recover replacements only if a concrete regression is established.

#### HPR-P25-021 — Manufacturer evidence as reusable versioned engineering data

Objective/justification: expose controlled compatible characteristic provisioning while
keeping current S01–S06 stores and immutable bytes. Evidence: S01–S06/S11, A01/A02,
X04–X06/X15. Owners/contracts: Simulation characteristic store; Assets/Party manufacturer
model identity; Topology installed association; Custody exact-fluid method; Workflow exact
approval. Functional/data: independent characteristic revisions, maps/axes/units/reference
states, definitions/interpolation validity, power/driver/speed/temperature/pressure/product
limits and technical-document evidence; original manufacturer, field-characterized,
estimate, synthetic and calibrated origins remain explicit. API: compatible import,
validation diagnostics, save/read/revision and controlled qualification; no arbitrary
formula payload. Persistence: reuse immutable append/query and independently stored
characteristics; add source metadata only through a settled forward version envelope.
Acceptance: Case C compatible second-manufacturer map without solver edits, no installed
asset change; cases B/I history, wrong-fluid/method/reference refusal, malformed/flat/
nonmonotonic map handling per selected law, out-of-map refusal, forged approval and
partial-insert rollback. Numerical obligations: frozen independent interpolation/endpoint/
derivative and limit tests for each new supported family; manufacturer data is not
industrial machine-law validation. D/H/N; no actual compressor certificates requested as
a mandatory development input; no real-source promotion of synthetic regulator data.

~~~~~~~~

### 7. API Contracts

No new API is part of this bounded documentation/historical outcome. Existing owner operations are listed in the runtime contract inventory below; no proposed endpoint is relabeled as implemented.

### 8. Persistence and Transactions

Owner schema and existing mapped domain/persistence types are preserved. Flyway history is immutable; any new database requirement uses an additive migration whose actual filename/version remains DISCOVERY_REQUIRED until the live chain is checked. Enforce meaningful owned references, catalog family, immutable revision/digest, expected-version/uniqueness and concurrent-writer guarantees in the actual database as appropriate. Do not impose cross-module foreign aggregates or assume application pre-checks prevent races. PostgreSQL is current; MySQL equivalence is not established. Completed documentation work adds no schema requirement. Actual transaction/lock/time semantics in the original source record take precedence over this common preservation rule.

### 9. Security

Authenticate through the actual configured chain; authorize before revealing protected existence, count, history, export or payload. Preserve company/resource scope, current effective responsibility, DENY precedence, audit actor provenance and fail-closed unavailable/unknown evidence. Never trust caller-constructed actor/claim/permission evidence or stale grants. Keep industrial IT/OT segregation and human decision authority; no PLC/RTU command or autonomous actuation. Do not store raw IdP tokens, secrets or unrestricted personal/claim payloads.

### 10. Testing

Matched executed task-specific source suites:

- No task-specific executed suite was independently matched. The module-level exact-head suite inventory is recorded below; it does not automatically verify this whole objective.

For remaining code scope, add focused domain-invariant and application tests, actual request/DTO/error and authorization contract tests, fresh PostgreSQL/Flyway/JPA/constraint/rollback tests, relevant negative/replay/concurrency cases and architecture/mapper checks. Reuse existing module tests and add actual class/case/source hashes to the CI inventory only when those tests exist. A Docker skip is not database proof. Documentation/preflight tasks use actual documentation consistency/link/inventory checks without claiming Java behavior was newly executed. Full/Fast/Docs evidence must retain exact SHA/run/attempt and required case membership.

### 11. Acceptance Criteria

- Original bounded artifacts remain present or their stronger approved replacement is explicitly recorded.
- Source/document assertions and matched test/CI provenance remain independently reproducible; no broader workflow closure is inferred.

### 12. Dependencies and Blockers

Canonical prerequisites: —. This completed scope remains accepted within its recorded limits.

### 13. Deliverables

The bounded objective, exact owner contracts/artifacts, meaningful verification and source-linked acceptance record. No new source deliverable is selected for this retained task.

### 14. Evidence and History

Source applicability: `e0d6cfc15e9e5f57bbfe4ddf2992fb0026cd22f8`; exact-head Full #713 / Fast #41 / Docs #358 and raw report verification as described in the baseline. A cumulative passing run does not invent an unlocated original task commit.

- `62613734923f2d909ff86911faadc44f1d470ebb` — exact registered-message commit; surviving paths matched to current tree.

### 15. Current Reconciliation Record

Initial canonical adoption, 2026-10-16: Historical task retained independently; objective and record applicability are bounded by the pinned source. Current implementation/planning states above are independent. Doc/preflight completion is not completion of the associated application workflow.

Original bounded record status: DESIGN COMPLETE.

Future discoveries, refined exact file scope, accepted tests, blockers and decisions belong here. Retain prior evidence; synchronize only status fields into ROADMAP/PHASES. Newly standalone work stays PENDING_BASELINE_APPROVAL until authorized.

## HAPI-601 — Supplied manufacturer maps, tables and limits

Phase: HPS-007 — Manufacturer Engineering Data

Legacy IDs: HPR-P25-054C

Priority: P1

Implementation Status: NOT_IMPLEMENTED

Planning Status: BLOCKED

Owning Module: `simulation` (actual source owner; package modules are not separate Maven artifacts)

Dependencies: HAPI-599

Cross-Repository Dependencies: HWEB-F04, HWEB-F05 — legacy HidraWEB consumer references, not backend implementation tasks.

### 1. Objective

Supplied manufacturer maps/tables/limits/axes/units/reference conditions and source evidence.

### 2. Existing Implementation

Party manufacturer references and Simulation bounded immutable equipment parameter revision storage exist internally. These are phase context, not automatic completion evidence for this task. Task-specific current artifacts were matched to the exact tree:

- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/api/rest/controller/SpringSimulationController.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/CreateSimulationModelUseCase.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/PublishSimulationRecommendationUseCase.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/QueueSimulationRunUseCase.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/SimulationEquipmentParameterApprovalEvidencePort.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/SimulationStoredPhysicalNetworkRevisionPort.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/TopologyChangeProposalPort.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationApplicationService.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationEquipmentParameterQualificationService.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationEquipmentParameterRevisionQueryService.java`
- `src/test/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/semantic/SimulationRecommendationSemanticRemediationTest.java`
- `src/test/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/semantic/SimulationRunSemanticRemediationTest.java`

No current file is invented to make a historical allowlist appear complete. Artifact presence and a tested narrow method do not establish the whole business workflow.

### 3. Missing or Incomplete Capabilities

Deliver governed supplied-fact authoring, approval/history and exact installed-unit binding; explicitly report unsupported families. The exact bounded remaining delivery is: Supplied manufacturer maps/tables/limits/axes/units/reference conditions and source evidence..

### 4. Functional Requirements

Immutable source revisions retain exact supplied facts; unsupported/missing curve/axis/unit/evidence stays incomplete, no interpolation engine or invented vendor data.

Preserve explicit lifecycle, required values, invalid-reference rejection, supported catalog families and uncertainty semantics from the original bounded record. Optional fields are not silently defaulted into engineering facts. A follow-on capability never changes the meaning of a completed preflight.

### 5. Architecture and Domain Design

Bounded Context: `simulation`; primary phase owns this obligation. Current immutable parameter owner remains Simulation until an explicitly authorized ownership change; no interpolation or solver expansion selected. Aggregate/invariant ownership follows the existing domain artifacts below; proposed aggregates must not duplicate another owner. Domain remains pure Java; application coordinates authorization/transactions through ports; REST and persistence/integration remain adapters.

- Domain ownership/invariants: DISCOVERY_REQUIRED for this task; reuse the exact owner inventory below before adding a proposed contract.
- Inbound ports: `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/CreateSimulationModelUseCase.java`, `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/PublishSimulationRecommendationUseCase.java`, `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/QueueSimulationRunUseCase.java`.
- Outbound ports: `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/SimulationEquipmentParameterApprovalEvidencePort.java`, `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/SimulationStoredPhysicalNetworkRevisionPort.java`, `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/TopologyChangeProposalPort.java`.
- Application services: `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationApplicationService.java`, `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationEquipmentParameterQualificationService.java`, `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationEquipmentParameterRevisionQueryService.java`.
- Primary/secondary adapters: DISCOVERY_REQUIRED for this task; reuse the exact owner inventory below before adding a proposed contract.

### 6. Exact File-Level Execution Plan

**CREATE — all filenames PROPOSED, not yet executable allowlist:**

- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/domain/model/ManufacturerCharacteristicRevision.java` — pure Java owned aggregate/value and invariants for supplied maps/tables/limits/axes/units/reference conditions, approved immutable source facts without interpolation.
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/ManufacturerCharacteristicRevisionUseCase.java` — typed command/query input and authorization-aware orchestration contract.
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/ManufacturerCharacteristicRevisionRepositoryPort.java` — owned persistence and expected-version contract.
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/ManufacturerCharacteristicRevisionApplicationService.java` — owner transaction, permission evidence and domain coordination.
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/api/rest/controller/ManufacturerCharacteristicRevisionController.java` — explicit request/response DTO mapping and documented errors.
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/infrastructure/persistence/adapter/JdbcManufacturerCharacteristicRevisionRepositoryAdapter.java` — PostgreSQL implementation with parameterized statements, constraints and concurrency checks.

**MODIFY — existing verified paths, if required by the admitted package:**

- `src/test/java/dz/sh/hidra/ArchitectureGuardrailTest.java` — add only approved exported contract enforcement if the feature introduces an actual cross-owner boundary.

- `.github/ci-test-inventory.json` — register actual new test classes/cases/source hashes; preserve existing lanes and fallback.

**DELETE:** none.

**PRESERVE / REUSE:**

- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/api/rest/controller/SpringSimulationController.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/CreateSimulationModelUseCase.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/PublishSimulationRecommendationUseCase.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/in/QueueSimulationRunUseCase.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/SimulationEquipmentParameterApprovalEvidencePort.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/SimulationStoredPhysicalNetworkRevisionPort.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/port/out/TopologyChangeProposalPort.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationApplicationService.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationEquipmentParameterQualificationService.java`
- `src/main/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/application/service/SimulationEquipmentParameterRevisionQueryService.java`
- `src/test/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/semantic/SimulationRecommendationSemanticRemediationTest.java`
- `src/test/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/semantic/SimulationRunSemanticRemediationTest.java`

**DISCOVERY_REQUIRED:** close request/response DTO filenames, actual bootstrap wiring and additive schema migration filename after checking live ownership, current migration inventory and writer order. Proposed source types require their focused invariant/application/API/PostgreSQL tests under the corresponding existing module test root. Reuse an existing equivalent type instead of creating a duplicate.

### 7. API Contracts

**PROPOSED, not existing:** `POST /api/v1/simulation/manufacturer-characteristics` for supplied maps/tables/limits/axes/units/reference conditions, approved immutable source facts without interpolation. Exact request/response DTO schemas, pagination/replay/idempotency fields and per-action effective grants require source-backed admission. Preserve all existing module operations in the runtime API inventory below.

### 8. Persistence and Transactions

Owner schema and existing mapped domain/persistence types are preserved. Flyway history is immutable; any new database requirement uses an additive migration whose actual filename/version remains DISCOVERY_REQUIRED until the live chain is checked. Enforce meaningful owned references, catalog family, immutable revision/digest, expected-version/uniqueness and concurrent-writer guarantees in the actual database as appropriate. Do not impose cross-module foreign aggregates or assume application pre-checks prevent races. PostgreSQL is current; MySQL equivalence is not established. Completed documentation work adds no schema requirement. Actual transaction/lock/time semantics in the original source record take precedence over this common preservation rule.

### 9. Security

Authenticate through the actual configured chain; authorize before revealing protected existence, count, history, export or payload. Preserve company/resource scope, current effective responsibility, DENY precedence, audit actor provenance and fail-closed unavailable/unknown evidence. Never trust caller-constructed actor/claim/permission evidence or stale grants. Keep industrial IT/OT segregation and human decision authority; no PLC/RTU command or autonomous actuation. Do not store raw IdP tokens, secrets or unrestricted personal/claim payloads.

### 10. Testing

Matched executed task-specific source suites:

- `src/test/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/semantic/SimulationRecommendationSemanticRemediationTest.java` — exact-head oracle suite 5 cases, zero failures/errors/skips.
- `src/test/java/dz/sh/hidra/modules/simulation/semantic/SimulationRunSemanticRemediationTest.java` — exact-head oracle suite 2 cases, zero failures/errors/skips.

For remaining code scope, add focused domain-invariant and application tests, actual request/DTO/error and authorization contract tests, fresh PostgreSQL/Flyway/JPA/constraint/rollback tests, relevant negative/replay/concurrency cases and architecture/mapper checks. Reuse existing module tests and add actual class/case/source hashes to the CI inventory only when those tests exist. A Docker skip is not database proof. Documentation/preflight tasks use actual documentation consistency/link/inventory checks without claiming Java behavior was newly executed. Full/Fast/Docs evidence must retain exact SHA/run/attempt and required case membership.

### 11. Acceptance Criteria

- Immutable source revisions retain exact supplied facts; unsupported/missing curve/axis/unit/evidence stays incomplete, no interpolation engine or invented vendor data.
- Prove the real owner/API/persistence path and negative cases; record exact source, actual executed and skipped cases and accepted contract artifact.
- Required transactions roll back fully; historical exact reads remain reproducible after source revision.
- Missing policy, unregistered file placement or unavailable authority is explicitly blocked rather than fabricated.
- Applicable Full/Fast/Docs acceptance succeeds on the implementation SHA; software acceptance remains separate from SITE commissioning.

### 12. Dependencies and Blockers

Canonical prerequisites: HAPI-599. A dependency edge does not select implementation. Resolve only the task-specific exact path/policy/source contract gaps described here before code; real deployment data is not a software-contract blocker.

### 13. Deliverables

The bounded objective, exact owner contracts/artifacts, meaningful verification and source-linked acceptance record. For implementation, deliver only the admitted CREATE/MODIFY set, public API evidence where required, fresh-schema proof where applicable and preserved historical behavior.

### 14. Evidence and History

Source applicability: `e0d6cfc15e9e5f57bbfe4ddf2992fb0026cd22f8`; exact-head Full #713 / Fast #41 / Docs #358 and raw report verification as described in the baseline. A cumulative passing run does not invent an unlocated original task commit.

- Independent original implementation commit identity was not matched for this bounded record; do not invent one.

### 15. Current Reconciliation Record

Initial canonical adoption, 2026-10-16: Historical task retained independently; objective and record applicability are bounded by the pinned source. Current implementation/planning states above are independent.

No single stronger current disposition was independently extracted; original recorded evidence retains its dated applicability.

Future discoveries, refined exact file scope, accepted tests, blockers and decisions belong here. Retain prior evidence; synchronize only status fields into ROADMAP/PHASES. Newly standalone work stays PENDING_BASELINE_APPROVAL until authorized.
