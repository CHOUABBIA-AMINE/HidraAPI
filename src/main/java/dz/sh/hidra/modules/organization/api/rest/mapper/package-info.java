/**
 * REST mapper package for translating between REST contracts and application commands, queries, or DTOs.
 *
 * <p>What belongs here:
 * Pure mapping code between API request/response objects and application-layer types.
 *
 * <p>What is forbidden here:
 * Repository access, business decisions, persistence mapping, identity domain imports, and topology domain imports.
 *
 * <p>Boundary rules:
 * {@literal modules.identity} owns users, identity roles, permissions, and access policies.
 * {@literal modules.organization} owns employees, organization units, positions, assignments,
 * and reporting lines. Future {@literal modules.topology} owns physical stations and topology
 * assets. Organization may reference topology later only through {@literal OperationalScopeReference}.
 * Platform owns technical infrastructure and Spring Security plumbing.
 *
 * <p>Station rule:
 * Station-as-organization-unit belongs to organization when it represents people,
 * responsibility, and operational reporting. The physical station asset belongs to topology.
 *
 * <p>Reporting rule:
 * Matrix reporting is represented later through {@literal ReportingLine}, not through
 * {@literal SupervisorAssignment}.
